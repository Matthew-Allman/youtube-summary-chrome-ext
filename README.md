# YouTube Video Summarizer Chrome Extension

This Chrome extension, built with React, Tailwind, and Webpack, allows you to summarize YouTube videos using OpenAI's GPT-4o mini model. You can summarize videos in three different ways:

1. **Highlight/Type in YouTube URL or Video ID**: Simply highlight or type in a YouTube URL or video ID.
2. **Get Current YouTube URL**: Automatically fetches the URL of the current YouTube video.
